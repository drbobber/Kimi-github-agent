## 🚀 Overview

Kimi GitHub Agent enables **fully autonomous development workflows**:

1. Create a GitHub issue with requirements
2. Agent picks it up automatically (when dependencies are met)
3. Kimi CLI implements the solution
4. PR is created and tested
5. On failure → Agent fixes and retries (max 3 attempts)
6. On success → Auto-merge

**Your only job: Write good issues. The agent does the rest.**
